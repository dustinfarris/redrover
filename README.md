# RedRover

RedRover is a testing utility suite for Django.  It wraps other powerful
tools such as Nose and Selinium into an easy to use and read syntax.

At its core, RedRover borrows from other python projects and provides
an interface with custom syntax sugar inspired by the RSpec and Capybara
projects that are used widely with Ruby on Rails.
